# LearnDash Auto-Rename Cloned Questions

This repository contains a custom WordPress snippet that automatically renames cloned LearnDash questions. When a quiz question is duplicated in LearnDash, this snippet ensures that the new question has a unique title by appending "Copy of" to the original title.

## Features

- Automatically appends "Copy of" to the title of cloned LearnDash questions.
- Helps prevent confusion by ensuring all cloned questions have distinct titles.
- Easy to integrate into any WordPress theme by adding the snippet to your `functions.php` file.

## Installation
- Add the code to your active WordPress theme's functions.php file.
- Once the snippet is added to your functions.php file and your theme is active, any new LearnDash quiz questions you clone will automatically have "Copy of" appended to their title.
